        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! First of all, thank you for visiting my website. It is a pleasure to meet you. :)</p>
        <p>My name is Kyle Gon√ßalves, and I'm a Bio-Medical & Bio-Physics Engineering major working as an Outsystems
            developer at Deloitte.</p>
        <p>With a passion for knowledge, I am eager to continuously learn new things every day!</p>
        <p>I'm currently aiming to deepen my knowledge in web development, learning languages such as HTML, JavaScript,
            and CSS. Parallely, I am eager to learn other fundamental topics in development, such as cloud computing,
            SQL development, and much more!</p>
        <p>Challenges are what keep me going, and quitting is not part of my vocabulary, no matter how hard the feat may
            seem. With a positive attitude and persistence, we can achieve anything.</p>
        <p>My primary life goals are to lean as much as I can, and travel the world. üõ©Ô∏è</p>
